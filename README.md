# explain xkcd Chrome Extension

[Install it here!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/explain-xkcd/fpmkngibepdfagmmmenjbfmgohlddakg)

A Chrome Extension that allows you to open the explanation wiki for any xkcd comic with the click of a button.

Whenever I don't understand an xkcd comic, I open a new tab and type "explain xkcd {title of comic I don't understand}" and click the first result. While this approach works fine, I'm too lazy to spend 5 seconds Googling the explanation myself, so I made this extension.

Now, you can click on the picture of man with the black hat at the top right of your browser and instantly navigate to the explanation page.
